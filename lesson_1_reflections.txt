How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see
the bug that was introduced?

        Comparing the 2 lines it is easy to see the change that introduced the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

        to see the cahnges made to the project

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

        pros: you can choose what you want to change
        cons: you can forget when to save

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

        because you can have an snapshot of the whole project

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

        git log gives you the logical changes
        git diff gives you the details of the cahnges between versions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

        you dont lose the head :)

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

        keep track of what I do in the computer :D
